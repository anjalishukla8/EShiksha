    <h1>DBMS NOTES</h1>


    <p>Database Management System (DBMS) is a software for storing and retrieving users’ data while considering
        appropriate security measures. It consists of a group of programs which manipulate the database. The DBMS
        accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific
        data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software to store and retrieve data.

        DBMS allows users to create their own databases as per their requirement. The term “DBMS” includes the user of

        application.
